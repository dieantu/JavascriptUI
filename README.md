# JavascriptUI
A simplified version of the SwiftUI concepts implemented in Javascript, which I labelled 'JavascriptUI'
#
Much like SwiftUI, I designed this small project to allow you to declare HTML application elements in a declarative fashion.  With this project you essentially initialize a UI class, and proceed to add Views to it, and each View can be combined with neighboring Views.  Once the views are all declared, the application will 'render' or create a series of DOM elements based on the Views it was given, and then the body of the HTML document will be replaced with these new nodes.
# Goals
Right now, this is a fun project that helps me personally understand SwiftUI and reactive/declarative approaches a little better, so I didn't attempt to take the concept all the way through to a publishable state.  However what I did provide is compact and clean and could be a good case study for others who want to examine the concepts behind the big brother versions of this tiny set of classes.

I hope you find this fun to browse and if you wish to fork or extend it you have my full support.
